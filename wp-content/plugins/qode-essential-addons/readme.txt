== Description ==

Qode Essential Addons enhances themes with various functionalities- Portfolio post type, Portfolio List, Blog List & Product List shortcodes and more.

The Qode Essential Addons is a completely stand-alone plugin created by <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com" target="_blank">Qode Interactive</a>. The plugin itself is not integrated into any theme by default, but it is used with all Qode themes as their vital part.

Although the Qode Essential Addons can be used with any theme, it is best used with Qode Interactive themes. In addition to expanding themes with the Portfolio custom post type, the Portfolio List, Blog List, Product List shortcodes as well as numerous other options, the plugin adds the administration panel when used with themes created by Qode.

The plugin relies on element modularity and the use of object-oriented programming. Fundamentally, the Qode Essential Addons plugin consists of a wide range of elements which exist independently of one another. This in turn makes for easy theme maintenance and keeps everything as transparent as it can get.

The plugin includes a huge number of hooks for countless actions and filters in themes to keep things fluid and clear. This makes way for a near limitless customization in themes that have this plugin activated.

One of the key points of the plugin is its general stability. Even after a major theme or plugin update, all changes that were previously made and saved remain safe.

The grid system is another notable feature of this plugin; grid size can be customized for every individual responsive stage on all list elements in themes when using Qode Essential Addons.

The plugin’s user dashboard bears that distinctive Qode Interactive touch, with a simple, coherent and intuitive interface design. When using <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com" target="_blank">Qode Interactive</a> themes with this plugin, users can look up any option on the fly - all it takes is typing a name or a keyword corresponding to an option in the field located at the top of the global theme options section. The search results will show up instantaneously; there’s no loading process involved.

Apart from being compatible with all WordPress themes, the Qode Essential Addons plugin is a vital part of the first free theme designed by <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com" target="_blank">Qode Interactive</a>, the Qi Theme. Qode Essential Addons gives you even more when used with the Qi Theme; you get a large set of additional options, as well as a one-click import module. There are two versions of Qi Theme available – the free version with 100 website demos, and the Premium edition with additional 50 diverse, modern website demos and enhanced options. You can check out the theme and its huge selection website examples <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/qi-theme/" target="_blank">here</a>.
